in Azure the metadata of an instance can be queried by a service called Azure Instance Metadata Service, its a REST API.

  I would use Python for this as it has a build in module "request" for REST API


import requests

url ="http://<instane-ip>/metadata/instance?api-version=2021-02-01&format=json"
response = requests.get(url)
response_json= response.json()
